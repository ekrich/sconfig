# sconfig
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ekrich/sconfig.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ekrich/sconfig)

Configuration library written in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) which is a direct translation 
of the original widely used Java library.

Scala JVM and [Scala Native](https://scala-native.readthedocs.io/) are currently supported
with the goal to add support for [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/).

For motivation and background about this project see the [PR](https://github.com/lightbend/config/pull/600) 
to the original project.

Care has been taken to keep the API the same but changes are needed when moving from the Java API.
Using Java is also possible because the included Java examples work. 

If you are looking for the original proven Java API, see

The following document copies are local to this repository but internal links may refer to the
original site documents via hyperlink. These are here as a snapshot when the library was ported
for reference purposes only. Refer to `config` library above to see the latest docs.

The intent is to keep the library in sync with the original but each PR needs to be be ported
to maintain feature parity. Changes to support Scala Native and Scala.js may make this goal
unattainable in the future.

[Scala Native](docs/SCALA-NATIVE.md) - A guide to using Scala Native.
