 * A set of options related to resolving substitutions. Substitutions use the

 * [[https://github.com/ekrich/sconfig/blob/master/HOCON.md">HOCON spec]].
 * <p>
 * Typically this class would be used with the method
 * [[Config!.resolve(options:org\.ekrich\.config\.ConfigResolveOptions)* Config.resolve(ConfigResolveOptions)]].
 * <p>
 * This object is immutable, so the "setters" return a new object.
 * <p>
 * Here is an example of creating a custom {@code ConfigResolveOptions}:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     ConfigResolveOptions options = ConfigResolveOptions.defaults()
 *         .setUseSystemEnvironment(false)
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In addition to {@link ConfigResolveOptions#defaults}, there's a prebuilt
 * {@link ConfigResolveOptions#noSystem} which avoids looking at any system
 * environment variables or other external system information. (Right now,
 * environment variables are the only example.)
